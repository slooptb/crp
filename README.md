## Website Performance Optimization

## Task 1 - index.html

PageSpeed Insights score before optimization - 28/100 mobile, 30/100 desktop

- Created Gruntfile.js and added minification tasks - 32/100 mobile, 34/100 desktop
- Resized views/images/pizzeria.jpg image to 100px wide - 77/100 mobile, 91/100 desktop
- Inlined CSS, removed webfont, made JS asynchronous - 95/100 mobile, 97/100 desktop

TODO: Personalize and alter image


## Task 2 - views/pizza.html

Remove JANK and optimize fps to 60fps or higher

- Removed forced synchronous layout from pizza resizing. Pizza's resize in under 1ms.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
